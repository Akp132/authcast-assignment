Here’s a clean and professional **README.md** for your project.

# 🌍 Earthquake API Service

A minimal backend service that wraps the USGS Earthquake API with added features like **caching**, **rate limiting**, and **HTML-rendered endpoints**.

---

## 📚 Features

* ✅ Fetch and display recent earthquake data.
* ✅ Filter results by date and magnitude.
* ✅ View detailed earthquake event information.
* ✅ In-memory **caching** to reduce redundant API calls.
* ✅ **Rate limiting** to prevent API abuse.
* ✅ Simple **HTML UI** for quick access via browser.
* ✅ Load testing using `autocannon`.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd earthquake-service
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PORT=3000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60       # Time window in seconds
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5           # Max requests per window per IP
CACHE_TTL=300               # Cache time-to-live in seconds
```

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
npm run dev   # Development mode with auto-reload
npm start     # Production mode
```

## 📖 API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                                              | Description                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/`                                                                   | Landing Page                        |
| `/earthquakes`                                                        | List recent earthquakes (HTML view) |
| `/earthquakes?starttime=YYYY-MM-DD&endtime=YYYY-MM-DD&minmagnitude=X` | Filter earthquakes                  |
| `/earthquakes/:id`                                                    | Detailed view of a specific event   |

---

## 📋 Example Usage

* [View All Recent Earthquakes](http://localhost:3000/earthquakes)
* [Filtered Query Example](http://localhost:3000/earthquakes?starttime=2025-05-01&endtime=2025-05-10&minmagnitude=5)
* [View Earthquake by ID](http://localhost:3000/earthquakes/ci41156296) *(Replace with a real event ID)*

---

## 📈 Load Testing

```bash
npm run loadtest
```

* Simulates 60 concurrent users for 20 seconds.
* Helps validate caching and rate limiting effectiveness.
